# Project Introduction

This project aims to use market response modelling to develop the right
marketing mix for a hypothetical telecommunications provider.

In this scenario, the telecommunications provider currently uses
traditional advertising (mainly TV) and Facebook to market its
subscriptions.


# Data

This project will analyse how effective the current channels are in
acquiring new customers. Therefore, the following data were collected:

-   number of newly acquired customers across 118 weeks
-   the investment in traditional advertising
-   the number of impressions of Facebook posts initiated by the
    telecommunications provider
-   information about media and buzz events, holiday periods, promotions
-   marketing buzz about the telecommunications provider on Twitter.

The variables and their descriptions are shown below:
